            </p> <p>Hi, My name is Ryan Russell and thank you for visiting my Profile.  Here I hope to give you a since of myself.  
				First, through this introduction I would like to explain to you who I am and tell you a bit about my life.  Second, 
				I would like to show you some of the work I have done that  would show my skills and abilities with several developer
				 languages and tools and Finally I would like to provide you with my contact information as well as a way for you 
				 to be able to reach out to me.
				 
				 <p>So if you have made it this far, you have probably learned the sound that gets my attention and that is my name.
					   I am horrible at talking about myself, but as you are well into the second paragraph, here goes!  To start 
					   with I am happily married (usually) and have been that way for 9+ years.  My wife and I (her name is 
					   Shelley) have no children, we have a puppy named Magnus.  We call her Maggie when we arenâ€™t trying to be formal.
						 Currently I am working in Educational Technology Management and she occupies her time with accounting. 
						  When I am not working or engaged in development, I like to both play and listen to music.  I have played for
						   several years and have picked up and attempted to play most any instrument.  I have actually been successful
						    at playing one or two.  With some of my other spare time, I like to travel and play with technology.
					</p>
			<p> While I have taken most of the last paragraph to explain my time outside of work.  I will this paragraph to explain 
				my time in work and what I am looking for to grow my career.  Since graduating college I have been involved with 
				helpdesk or end user support in some way or another.  I have worked on a few different help desks working with general
				 consumer grade products to managing helpdesk in which I supported more specialized and industry specific products. 
				  I have always excelled in a help desk role due to my strong communication skills and my abilities to translate technical
				   issues to non technical users in an effort to convey problems and messages.
